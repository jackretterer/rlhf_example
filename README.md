# Dialogue Refiner: An Intro to RLHF

This is a GitHub repo designed to introduce MLE and SWEs to RLHF. The goal is to take existing LLMs and make them more helpful and harmless. This repo leverages Anthropic's public hh-rlhf repo [link](https://github.com/anthropics/hh-rlhf/tree/master). This is a very basic and beginner implementation. If you'd like a more advanced repo please visit XYZ.
